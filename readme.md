This is a plugin to build a certain workflow when working on an elm project. 

Features:
- bindings to navigate the compiler output
- better syntax highlighting of the cited code
- jump to the source of the cited code
- insert type annotations for functions

This also contains mappings I use for all my elm projects, because I'm the only
one using this plugin anyway :-)

The `<leader>am` opens the `compiler.elmc` buffer and puts the output of `elm-make` there.
